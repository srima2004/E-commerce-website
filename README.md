These files include both the front-end (React) and the backend (Spring Boot with a RESTful API).
You'll need to install the node modules manually, as they are large and couldn't be uploaded here.
Installation Instructions:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Navigate to the project directory.
3.Run npm install to install dependencies (since node_modules is not included).
4.Start the development server with npm start.
